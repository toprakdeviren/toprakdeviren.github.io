        <main class="about-content">
            <p>Born in 1986 in Izmir, Turkey, I've been fascinated by computers and programming since my early years. My
                journey in software development began in 2001, sparked by curiosity about how video games were made,
                leading me to explore languages like QBasic, Visual Basic, Pascal, and Turbo C during high school.</p>

            <h2>Education and Early Career</h2>
            <p>I pursued an Associate Degree in Computer Programming at Celal Bayar University from 2004 to 2006. By the
                end of my first year, I was already developing web pages with ASP, drawing on my background in QBasic
                and Visual Basic. This period also saw me delve into JavaScript, SQL, and database management.</p>

            <p>After graduating in 2006, I worked as a freelance web developer until 2008, when I joined Ihlas Holding
                as a Web Developer. There, I developed corporate web applications and mobile apps, implemented PDF
                generation tools using Java, and published applications on iOS and Android stores.</p>

            <h2>Enterprise Software Development</h2>
            <p>From 2015 to 2024, I served as a Senior Software Engineer at Very Electric Car, where I led the
                development of a high-security enterprise messaging application published on Apple's Business Store.
                This role allowed me to implement robust end-to-end encryption, develop cross-platform frameworks for
                the Apple ecosystem (iOS, iPadOS, macOS), and optimize performance for high-scale systems.</p>

            <h2>Cryptography and Secure Messaging Expertise</h2>
            <p>Throughout my career, I've specialized in developing secure messaging applications and cryptographic
                solutions. I've implemented the Double Ratchet algorithm for end-to-end encryption and gained extensive
                experience with push notifications, WebRTC for voice and video calls, and Apple's CallKit APIs.</p>

            <p>My interest in secure communications led me to explore advanced cryptographic protocols, including MLS
                (Messaging Layer Security), LibSodium, and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQECDH).</p>

            <h2>Side Projects and Explorations</h2>
            <p>In 2013, I developed <span class="project-name">Edurel</span>, a social education platform enabling
                students to ask questions, form virtual classrooms, and engage in educational discussions.</p>

            <p>In 2015, I developed a custom neural network from scratch for natural language processing, implementing
                fuzzy logic for advanced text analysis and response generation.</p>

            <p>In 2020, I ventured into cryptocurrency technologies, developing AI-powered trading bots using Binance
                APIs and working on Solana network projects with Web3.js.</p>

            <h2>Current Focus: LibMessageKit</h2>
            <p>Since 2023, I've been working as an independent software developer and consultant, focusing on an
                innovative, end-to-end encrypted and anonymous messaging application. I've developed and maintain
                open-source projects including LibMessageKit, LibMessageKit-NetworkLayer, and SML (SecureMessageLayer).
            </p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Project Architecture</h3>
                <p>My current project is divided into three main components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LibMessageKit:</strong> An open-source C library for building secure, end-to-end
                        encrypted messaging applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>LibMessageKit-NetworkLayer:</strong> A TCP Socket Networking Module.</li>
                    <li><strong>SML (Secure Message Layer):</strong> A cryptographic module implementing DoubleRatchet
                        and MLS protocols.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I've implemented the core library in C with WebAssembly integration for cross-platform compatibility.
                    On the server side, I use virtualization with LXC, manage firewalls with NFTables, and utilize NGINX
                    for server management. The system employs LibTLS (OpenBSD) for TLS socket communications and
                    Libsodium for cryptography, supporting PQECDH.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Throughout my 23-year career in software development, I've continuously pushed the boundaries of secure
                communication technology, from web development to mobile apps, from cryptography to AI and blockchain. I
                remain passionate about creating secure, efficient, and innovative solutions for digital communication.
