## üìù About This Blog

Welcome to my technical blog repository! This site focuses on applied cryptography, secure messaging architectures, and the evolution of privacy-focused communication protocols.

With 23+ years of experience in software development and a specialization in encryption technologies, I share insights, analyses, and technical deep-dives that go beyond the surface level of what's typically discussed in mainstream tech media.

## üîç Focus Areas

- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** protocols and implementations
- **Peer-to-Peer Encryption (P2PE)** as the future of secure messaging
- **Cryptographic protocol design** and security analyses
- **Secure messaging architecture** and best practices
- **Privacy considerations** in digital communication
