                <p>Discussions about artificial intelligence (AI) are often far from scientific, and some are philosophical, making them difficult to understand at times. In this article, I'll address some common misconceptions and facts about AI.</p>
                
                <h2>AI and Science Fiction</h2>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Unfortunately, AI can easily become material for science fiction, like teleportation, aliens, time travel, and parallel universes. This makes it prone to manipulation and misuse. Isaac Asimov's <strong>"I, Robot"</strong> and Asimov's <strong>Laws of Robotics</strong> are prime examples of this.</li>
                    <li>Humanoid robots have long been a source of inspiration for novelists. Characters like Pinocchio and Frankenstein have provided great material for the imagination.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Matrix</strong> film and story fed off this topic so much that the AI subject was overhyped and went to absurd, unscientific extremes. Unfortunately, being realistic can sometimes be disappointing. However, AI is too valuable a technology to be reduced to a science fiction trope.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>The True Nature of AI</h2>
                
                <p>AI is nothing more than software that gives fuzzy answers to linear problems. Just as we have artificial hearts, this is a computer program that mimics human intelligence. It can't gain consciousness or take over us. It has no perception of the world or life, nor can it have one.</p>
                
                <p>Claims about AI are, like parallel universes, the imagination of skilled novelists. Believing in such tales is like believing that Transformers or Thanos are real.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    AI is a sophisticated tool designed to solve complex problems, not a sentient entity with desires, consciousness, or an agenda of its own.
                </blockquote>
                
                <h2>Social Media and AI Myths</h2>
                
                <p>People who want to earn more money on social media, who have only heard about AI after ChatGPT, are producing video content that exaggerates baseless, unfounded, and unscientific romantic claims about the subject. This makes them look as ridiculous as amateur copycat writers without strong writing skills.</p>
                
                <div class="section-divider">
                    <hr>
                </div>
                
                <h2>AI's Place in the Business World</h2>
                
                <p>AI can't take your job away; it can only help you do your job better and with higher quality. Just as image processing programs like Photoshop didn't leave designers jobless, AI will contribute to whatever job you do.</p>
                
                <p>Saying that AI will surpass humans in every field is like saying a mosquito can lift a mountain. If realistic research were done before indulging in romantic fantasies about this subject, such ridiculous situations wouldn't arise.</p>
                
                <h2>Recognizing AI-Generated Content</h2>
                
                <p>AI-generated data (images, text, code) is often immediately recognizable and gives an artificial feeling. This results from the low-quality output of statistical processing of linear problem data.</p>
                
                <div class="section-divider">
                    <hr>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                
                <p>As a final note, to avoid sounding presumptuous, I hesitate to mention that I've been working with AI since 2008. I've written my own neural network and developed many systems that receive fuzzy answers. I've read many sources and done research on the history of the subject.</p>
                
                <p>AI should be evaluated with a realistic perspective, free from exaggerated expectations and fears. Only in this way can we understand the true potential of this technology and make the best use of it.</p>
